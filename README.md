# WeatherApp

##README.md

Made a weather website to be able to go to when you would like to know the weather for the next 5 days, the UV index, wind, and humidity (which we definitely get here in Ontario).

This was a very hurried project, and I hope to come back and do it justice in the future.

I created this webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
